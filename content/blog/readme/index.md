Hi, my beautiful lovelies ğŸ¥°. This is my first chooche at the website for peoples musings and what not. It's very simple right now, but also inoffensive and very performant. Let me know if you think anything should change? ğŸ¥°

### How to publish

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/GBCharlie/redesigned-bassoon)
2. Add whatever content you want to the `/content` directory.
3. Pull request back into the master branch of this repo.
4. Travis will build the everything and boof all of your wonderful content out to the CDN (github pages in this case)
5. YAY! That's all ğŸ¥°

### Things I'll add soon

- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] The ability to add author data at the top of Markdown files and then have gatsby build it into pages.
- [ ] Ability to push to IPFS instead of a conventional CDN
- [ ] Probably lots of other stuff. I'm tiered and working on this made me very sad. RIP Github RIP LIL PEEP.

### Other than that everything is up to you guys

If you decide you think the page should look different. I can do that. If you decide you don't like the whole Markdown monorepo thing. We can change it to a CMS like Contentful or Worldpress. We can also pick a domain name any time you like and it's whatever man like Sia always says.

### A fun thing to try
Put your phone on airplane mode. The website should still work. WOW. So cool

As Kanye West said:

Ok, Bye guys. Love you ğŸ’†
