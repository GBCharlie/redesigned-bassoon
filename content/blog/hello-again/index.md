Hello everybody.

### Fuck
Using curse words commonly in your vocabulary often will lead others to believe that you are not very intelligent.   
Why is this? Is it because the constant use of swear words is an indication of a lack of a diverse and well-rounded vocabulary?
Or could it be that those who swear have less control over their emotions and mind than most, leading them to spout obscenities over the most commonplace of situations and social exchanges?
Or is it that swearing makes you a bad person, and we all know bad people are dumber than good people. I mean, it's only fair, right?  
All of these are wrong and swearing is fucking awesome! Scratch that. Swearing is stupid. Actually swearing is inherently meaningless. It's another human-made construct so that we can pretend
that certain words hold more power or can inflict pain onto others when in reality me saying "shit", "fuck", or "cock-sucking-mother-father-dicking-asshole" would almost always (unless said to a complete and total prude) be less offensive than crafting a meaningful personal attack towards someone which is devoid of any curse words.

### Fatuous
So what is the point of me discussing this matter? Is it to justify my incessant use of the fuck-word? Or perhaps I wish to stroke my ego and sound soooo smart while talking about society and how everyone in it is just not nearly as woke as I am. Or is it all bullcrap? To be Frank, "hurr durr I am Frank and I am an idiot dumb ass". However, to be me, I believe this is all for the most part a useless discussion. The fact of the matter is that even if this is an important topic to discuss or spread light on in regards to the meaningless negative sentiment towards cursing, this writing will motivate practically no-one to do any real reflection or critical thinking on their current stance with this issue.

### Finish
There is however one aspect of this writing which I believe to have purpose, and that is for my own personal edification. It is not that this topic necessarily holds significant weight in my life, although it has applied to a lot of my life, but it is more so that it is helpful for me to practice using my brain. It's really easy for me, and likely most people, to go weeks without having to focus or critically think about an idea.  

To summarize, the purpose of this post transcends its main topic. Its purpose is itself. Its purpose is that I write something which requires me to actively think about what I am doing in the current moment. Something which forces me to think harder than I usually want to. And perhaps this could also serve to help someone else see if this type of exercise could be beneficial to their life, or even help them to ideate other ways that they could practice stimulating their brain more than they are able to on a general day-to-day basis. But to reiterate, this is mainly to help myself. I am a fairly borked human and I need to do fairly borked things to un-bork my borked up brain.

I'd like to end this post with an inspiring quote by the late rapper Christopher Wallace:
 >You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick.

 Love you all, and I hope you enjoy Bill Gates' micro-drone army being injected into your bloodstreams ðŸ¤—.
