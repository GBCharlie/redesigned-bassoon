This is my first chooche at the website for peoples musings and what not. It‚Äôs very simple right now, but also inoffensive and very performant. Let me know if you think anything should change? ü•∞</p>\n<h3>How to publish</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Fork the <a href=\"https://github.com/GBCharlie/redesigned-bassoon\">repository</a></li>\n<li>Add whatever content you want to the <code class=\"language-text\">/content</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Pull request back into the master branch of this repo.</li>\n<li>Travis will build the everything and boof all of your wonderful content out to the CDN (github pages in this case)</li>\n<li>YAY!

RIP Github RIP LIL PEEP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other than that everything is up to you guys</h3>\n<p>If you decide you think the page should look different. I can do that. If you decide you don‚Äôt like the whole Markdown monorepo thing. We can change it to a CMS like Contentful or Worldpress. We can also pick a domain name any time you like and it‚Äôs whatever man like Sia always says.</p>\n<h3>A fun thing to try</h3>\n<p>Put your phone on airplane mode. The website should still work. WOW. So cool</p>\n<p>As Kanye West said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We‚Äôre living the future so\nthe present is our past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, Bye guys.
